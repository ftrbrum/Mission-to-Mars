# Mission-to-Mars
Module 10


## Overview of Analysis
After creating Robin's web app she wanted to add some more polish.  She would like to add the four Mars Hemisphere images off of a web scraping friendly site.  We are going to do this using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape the images and titles of the Mars Hempisphere's to store the data on a Mongo database.  We will use a web application to display the data and alter the design of the web app to acomodate the images.
